[Betrayal at House on the Hill](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-house-hill) is a tile game that allows players to build their own haunted house room by room, tile by tile, creating a new thrilling game board every time.

Betrayal is hands-down one of the best thematic role-playing games I've played. I have played it four different times till now, and each game play has been a unique experience, yet equally exciting and exhilarating as all the other plays. More than the game itself, it is the story-telling and ambience that the game creates that fascinated me to no end. The suspense build-up, the (very realistic) haunted house exploration phase, and the actual haunt itself creates an immersive experience that few other board games have been able to achieve.
