[King of New York](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160499/king-new-york) is an area-control game that allows players to role-play as monsters trying to take over the city of New York, competing with one another.

There are multiple aspects of this game that make it incredibly enjoyable. Each monster can move in and out of the five boroughs of New York City, destroying building and military units, and occasionally attacking each other. The game scales beautifully with more players, and provides a different and unique gameplay each time you play it. It has a small deck-building component, where monsters collect power cards to enable special abilities. Few actions are all-powerful; most come with caveats and trade-offs. It plays in less than 45 minutes with 3 players, and has a fast-paced and riveting gameplay.

I also love the physical tokens and pieces of this game. The dice and the energy cubes are aesthetically pleasing, the health and victory point markers have an intuitive mechanism, each monster has a distinct yet consistent look, and the power card artwork looks straight out of a comic book.

This ranks perhaps third in my top 10 favorite board games, and I look forward to playing it many more times.
