## Programming

 * [Do-nothing scripting](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/) is a great way of automating a process by doing it in logical snippets, while retaining the value of a small script that automates only a small part to begin with. This will also help in building small utilities that can be re-used across processes.
 * Consider using existing tools even if they don't involve programming. Discovered [an excellent workflow](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tools/OpenRefine/Editing/Tutorials/Basic_editing) for importing data to Wikidata through a combination of Google Sheets, [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) and [QuickStatements](https://tools.wmflabs.org/quickstatements/#/batch)

## Open Source

 * There's more than one way to contribute to open-source. Even contributing to open-source data repositories such as Wikidata is incredibly useful. It also exposes one to the various tools for contributing data, and opens up the platform to improve these tools themselves.
