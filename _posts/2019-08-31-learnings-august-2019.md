August has been a really good month in that I've made good progress both at work and in my personal project. For work, I feel like I have a better understanding of some of the complex problems that exist right now, and hints about how I can work on solving them. As far as my project on building a toolkit for Wikidata, I understand a lot more about Wikidata, the community and how to develop a flexible tool that can tackle multiple domains.

## Miscellaneous

 * Use `pyreverse` to generate architecture (UML class + package) diagrams for Python projects. These look great on the repo, and allow you to get a bird's eye view of all the classes you have designed so far.
 * GitHub has a Kanban tool! Use it to keep track of personal projects, especially when you have tasks that aren't big enough to be issues, and when you want to retain context over coding sessions.
 * One of the best times to write tutorial posts is when you are learning it yourself; this results in the tutorial actually being from a beginner's perspective, and consequently easier to follow. As a side-effect, you end up documenting your mistakes and the process you followed for learning it.
