<h2>Havan Agrawal</h2>
I am a passionate software developer and an aspiring machine learning engineer.
My primary interest is in large-scale system design and software engineering, and applied machine learning.


I've worked as a software engineer at [Morgan Stanley](http://www.morganstanley.com) in the Equity Derivatives segment. In the summer of 2018, I interned at [Amazon Lab126](https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/lab126) as a Software Developer, where I worked on a data pipeline for an upcoming smart-home product. I also interned at Google with the [Google Cloud Platform - Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/) team, where I worked with a plethora of Google technologies such as [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice), and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), as well as proprietary core Java libraries. I completed the [Master's in Data Science](https://www.datasciencemasters.uw.edu) program from the University of Washington (March 2019), and have a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from Mumbai University.
