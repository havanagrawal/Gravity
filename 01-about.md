<h2>Havan Agrawal</h2>
I am a passionate software developer and an aspiring machine learning engineer.
My primary interest is in large-scale system design and software engineering, and applied machine learning.


I've worked as a software engineer at [Morgan Stanley](http://www.morganstanley.com) in the Equity Derivatives segment for two years. In the summer of 2018, I interned at [Amazon Lab126](https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/lab126) as a Software Developer, where I worked on a data pipeline for an upcoming smart-home product. I completed the [Master's in Data Science](https://www.datasciencemasters.uw.edu) program from the University of Washington (March 2019), and have a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology from Mumbai University.

I currently work at Google with the [Google Cloud Platform - Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/) team, where I work with a plethora of Google technologies such as <span class="tooltip">Protocol Buffers<span class="tooltiptext">Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.</span></span>, <span class="tooltip">Guice<span class="tooltiptext">a lightweight dependency injection framework by Google</span></span>, and <span class="tooltip">gRPC<span class="tooltiptext">a modern open source high performance RPC framework</span></span>, as well as proprietary core Java libraries.

Outside of work, I am a voracious reader, incredibly fascinated with science fiction in particular. I am a huge board game geek, having played [upward of 40 different board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/geekplay.php?userid=2118760&redirect=1&startdate=2018-01-01&dateinput=2018-01-01&dateinput=&enddate=&action=bygame&subtype=boardgame) (and counting). I am also extremely passionate about teaching computer science, particularly to undergraduate students.
